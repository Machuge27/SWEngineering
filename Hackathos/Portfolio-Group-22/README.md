### _I had planed to use this repo to store all my coding practocals for this course, so i din't want to create a new repo! hence the trick:_

- I modified the static.yml file, changing the path to the directory containing my portfolio files thus github knows where to look:

```yml
- name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # Upload entire repository
          path: './Hackathos/Portfolio-Group-22'
```
