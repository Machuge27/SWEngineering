# Expense Tracker

A simple expense tracker application built with **Express.js** for the backend and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend. This application allows users to authenticate, manage expenses, and calculate total expenses.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login with JWT.
- **Expense Management**: Add, view, update, and delete expenses.
- **Expense Calculation**: Calculate the total expenses for the user.
- **Secure Backend**: Password hashing and token-based authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js installation.
- **A Static File Server** (e.g., `serve`, `http-server`) for serving the frontend.

---

## How to Run the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/expense-tracker.git
cd expense-tracker
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add the following:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend/public` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend/public
   ```

2. Serve the static files using any static file server. For example, using `npx serve`:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```

   This will serve the frontend at `http://localhost:5000` (default port for `serve`).

---

### 4. Access the Application

1. Open the frontend in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

2. Use the mock credentials to log in (as set in the backend). For example:
   - **Username**: `user1`
   - **Password**: `password123` (hashed in the mock database).

3. Once logged in, you can:
   - View your expenses.
   - Add new expenses.
   - Update or delete existing expenses.
   - View your total expenses.

---

## Mock Data

The application uses mock data for demonstration purposes. You can update the backendâ€™s `auth.js` and `expenses.js` files to integrate with a real database like MongoDB or MySQL.

---

## Security Features

- Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt**.
- **JWT** is used for secure authentication and authorization.
- Input validation is applied to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or XSS.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a real database for persistence (e.g., MongoDB).
- Implement a registration feature.
- Add filtering and sorting options for expenses.
- Improve frontend design with a framework like React or Vue.
