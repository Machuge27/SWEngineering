## 1. Introduction to AI Software Tools

AI software tools are essential for developing, training, and deploying machine learning models. These tools provide libraries, frameworks, and environments that simplify the implementation of complex algorithms. In this tutorial, we will explore five popular AI tools: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebooks. We will discuss each tool in detail, provide examples, and demonstrate how to implement them in Python.

Let's implement a simple image classification task using Caffe. Note that Caffe is primarily used with its own configuration files (prototxt) and requires installation.

**Step 1: Install Caffe**

Follow the official installation guide: [Caffe Installation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).

**Step 2: Define the Model Architecture (model.prototxt)**

```protobuf
name: "SimpleCNN"
layer {
  name: "data"
  type: "Input"
  top: "data"
  input_param { shape: { dim: 1 dim: 1 dim: 28 dim: 28 } }
}
layer {
  name: "conv1"
  type: "Convolution"
  bottom: "data"
  top: "conv1"
  convolution_param {
    num_output: 20
    kernel_size: 5
    stride: 1
  }
}
layer {
  name: "pool1"
  type: "Pooling"
  bottom: "conv1"
  top: "pool1"
  pooling_param {
    pool: MAX
    kernel_size: 2
    stride: 2
  }
}
layer {
  name: "fc1"
  type: "InnerProduct"
  bottom: "pool1"
  top: "fc1"
  inner_product_param {
    num_output: 10
  }
}
layer {
  name: "prob"
  type: "Softmax"
  bottom: "fc1"
  top: "prob"
}
```

**Step 3: Train the Model**

```bash
caffe train -solver solver.prototxt -model model.prototxt
```

**Step 4: Use Python to Interact with Caffe**

```python
import caffe

# Load the model
net = caffe.Net('model.prototxt', 'model.caffemodel', caffe.TEST)

# Load an image and preprocess it
image = caffe.io.load_image('image.jpg', color=False)
image = caffe.io.resize(image, (28, 28))
image = image.reshape(1, 1, 28, 28)

# Perform inference
net.blobs['data'].data[...] = image
output = net.forward()
print(output['prob'])
```
