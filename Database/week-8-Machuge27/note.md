## Recap SQL INSERT Clause:

In SQL, the INSERT statement is used to add new records or rows into a table. This fundamental operation is vital for populating a database with data. The INSERT statement allows you to specify the values for each column or copy data from another table, enabling you to dynamically grow and maintain your database.

## SQL DELETE Rows from Related Tables:

When dealing with related tables (tables with foreign key relationships), deleting rows requires special consideration to maintain data integrity. If foreign key constraints are defined, you may need to delete rows from related tables first or handle the deletion through cascading actions.
