GRANT INSERT ON bills.* TO 'bob'@'localhost';

"""
This SQL statement is used to grant specific privileges to a user in a MySQL database. Let's break it down:

GRANT INSERT: This part of the statement specifies the type of privilege being granted. In this case, it is the INSERT privilege, which allows the user to insert new rows into tables.

ON bills.*:: This specifies the scope of the privilege. Here, bills.* means that the INSERT privilege is being granted on all tables within the bills database. The * is a wildcard that represents all tables.

TO 'bob'@'localhost';: This specifies the user to whom the privilege is being granted. In this case, the user is bob, and the @'localhost' part specifies that this user can only use this privilege when connecting from the local machine (localhost).

In summary, this statement allows the user bob to insert data into any table within the bills database, but only when bob is connecting from the local machine.
