Yes, you can perform queries on a `.sql` file, but the process involves the following steps:

### 1. **Load the `.sql` file into a database**
   - Use a database management system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) to execute the file and load the data.

### 2. **Query the data**:
   - Once the file is executed and data is loaded, you can query it using SQL commands.

---

### Example using SQLite:
#### Step 1: Load the file
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Enter SQLite:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 database_name.db
   ```
3. Load the `.sql` file:
   ```sql
   .read bills.sql
   ```

#### Step 2: Query the data
Now you can run SQL queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bills;
```

---

### Example using MySQL:
1. Log in to MySQL:
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p
   ```
2. Use a database:
   ```sql
   USE database_name;
   ```
3. Import the file:
   ```sql
   SOURCE /path/to/bills.sql;
   ```
4. Run queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM bills;
   ```



Yes! The issue is that those files are inside subdirectories that contain their own `.git` repositories. Git treats them as **submodules** or separate repositories, preventing you from adding them to your main repository.

### **Solution 1: Remove the Nested Git Repositories**
If you donâ€™t need the nested `.git` repositories inside those directories and just want to push everything to your general repo:

1. **Remove the `.git` folder in each subdirectory**  
   Run the following command inside each problematic subdirectory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   ```
   Or if you're inside your main project directory, run:
   ```bash
   find . -name ".git" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
   ```
   This will remove all nested `.git` directories.

2. **Re-add the files to your main repository**  
   After removing the `.git` folders, add and commit everything:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added all files to main repo"
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### **Solution 2: Convert Nested Repos into Subdirectories**
If you need to keep the history of the nested repositories:

1. **Remove them from Git's tracking as submodules:**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached Database/week-1-introduction-to-sql-Machuge27
   git rm --cached Database/week-2-data-retrieval-and-operation-Machuge27
   ```
   (Do this for all problematic directories)

2. **Re-add them as normal directories:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Converted submodules to normal directories"
   git push origin main
   ```

Let me know which solution works best for you! ðŸš€



Yes, submodules **can** affect how your files are accessed in GitHub. Hereâ€™s how:  

1. **If You Keep the Submodules**  
   - When you push your main repository, GitHub will **not** display the actual files inside those submodules.  
   - Instead, it will show a reference to the submodule's commit from the separate repository.  
   - If someone clones your main repo, they will need to run:  
     ```bash
     git submodule update --init --recursive
     ```
     to fetch the submodules.  
   - If your submodules are private or deleted, they **won't** be accessible.

2. **If You Remove the Submodules (Recommended for Your Case)**  
   - The files from the submodules will be part of the **main repository** like normal files.  
   - Anyone accessing your GitHub repo will see and download all files without needing extra steps.  
   - This is the best approach if you want a **single unified repo** without external dependencies.  

### **To Fix It & Ensure All Files Are in Your General Repo:**
#### âœ… **Remove the submodules & Add Their Contents to Your Main Repo**
```bash
# Step 1: Remove the submodules (this will untrack them)
git rm --cached Database/week-1-introduction-to-sql-Machuge27
git rm --cached Database/week-2-data-retrieval-and-operation-Machuge27
# Do this for all affected folders

# Step 2: Delete the submodules' .git directories to prevent conflicts
rm -rf Database/week-1-introduction-to-sql-Machuge27/.git
rm -rf Database/week-2-data-retrieval-and-operation-Machuge27/.git
# Do this for all submodules

# Step 3: Add everything back to your main repo
git add .
git commit -m "Merged submodules into main repository"
git push origin main
```
### **ðŸ”¹ Now, all files will be in your GitHub repo and accessible normally.** ðŸš€
