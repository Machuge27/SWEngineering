Yes, you can perform queries on a `.sql` file, but the process involves the following steps:

### 1. **Load the `.sql` file into a database**
   - Use a database management system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) to execute the file and load the data.

### 2. **Query the data**:
   - Once the file is executed and data is loaded, you can query it using SQL commands.

### Example using SQLite:
#### Step 1: Load the file
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Enter SQLite:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 database_name.db
   ```
3. Load the `.sql` file:
   ```sql
   .read bills.sql
   ```

#### Step 2: Query the data
Now you can run SQL queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bills;
```

### Example using MySQL:
1. Log in to MySQL:
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p
   ```
2. Use a database:
   ```sql
   USE database_name;
   ```
3. Import the file:
   ```sql
   SOURCE /path/to/bills.sql;
   ```
4. Run queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM bills;
   ```
