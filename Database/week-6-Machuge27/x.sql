-- Assignment Questions
-- üí≥ Bills and Payments Table Join
-- You have two tables, bills and payments, where the BillID column is common between them. Write an SQL query that uses INNER JOIN to retrieve the following details:

-- TotalAmount and Status from the bills table.
-- DueDate, PaymentMethod, and PaymentAmount from the payments table.

SELECT 
    b.TotalAmount, 
    b.Status, 
    b.DueDate, 
    p.PaymentMethod, 
    p.PaymentAmount
FROM 
    bills b
INNER JOIN 
    payments p ON b.BillID = p.BillID;

-- üõçÔ∏è Customer and Bills Table Join
-- You have two tables, customer and bills, where the customerID column is common between them. Write an SQL query that uses LEFT JOIN to retrieve the following details:

-- customerName, email, and customerAddress from the customer table.
-- TotalAmount and Status from the bills table.

SELECT
    c.customerName,
    c.email,
    c.customerAddress,
    b.TotalAmount,
    b.Status
FROM
    customer c
LEFT JOIN
    bills b ON c.customerID = b.customerID;

-- üßæ Bills and Bill Items Table Join
-- You have two tables, bills and bill_items, where the BillID column is common between them. Write an SQL query that uses RIGHT JOIN to retrieve the following details:

-- BillDate and DueDate from the bills table.
-- Status, ItemDescription, Quantity, and LineTotal from the bill_items table.
-- Calculate the difference in days between BillDate and DueDate as Number_of_Days.

SELECT
    B.BillDate,
    B.DueDate,
    B.Status,
    BI.ItemDescription,
    BI.Quantity,
    BI.LineTotal,
    DATEDIFF(b.DueDate, b.BillDate) AS Number_of_Days
FROM
    bills B
RIGHT JOIN
    bill_items BI ON B.BillID = BI.BillID;

SELECT 
    b.BillDate, 
    b.DueDate,

-- üë§ One-to-One Relationship: Users and User Profiles
-- You are given two tables, users and user_profiles, where:

-- The users table contains user_id and username.
-- The user_profiles table contains profile_id, user_id, and profile_data.
-- Write an SQL query to create the two tables, ensuring the following:

-- The users table has user_id as the primary key and a username.
-- The user_profiles table has profile_id as the primary key, and it references the user_id from the users table with a foreign key constraint.
-- Ensure that the user_id in the user_profiles table is unique, creating a one-to-one relationship between the two tables.

CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    profile_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT UNIQUE,
    profile_data TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

-- üë• One-to-Many Relationship: Departments and Employees
-- You are given two tables, departments and employees, where:

-- The departments table contains department_id and department_name.
-- The employees table contains employee_id, employee_name, and department_id.
-- Write an SQL query to create the two tables, ensuring the following:

-- The departments table has department_id as the primary key and a department_name.
-- The **employees ** table has employee_id as the primary key, and the department_id is a foreign key referencing the department_id in the departments table.
-- The relationship between departments and employees is a one-to-many relationship (one department can have multiple employees).

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);

-- üìã Categories, Bills, and Customer Tables Join
-- You are given three tables: categories, bills, and customer, where:

-- The categories table contains CategoryID and CategoryName.
-- The bills table contains BillID, CategoryID, TotalAmount, and DueDate.
-- The customer table contains CustomerID, customerName, and customerAddress.
-- Write an SQL query that uses INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to retrieve the following details:

-- CategoryName from the categories table.
-- TotalAmount and DueDate from the bills table.
-- customerName and customerAddress from the customer table.

SELECT 
    c.CategoryName, 
    b.TotalAmount, 
    b.DueDate, 
    cu.customerName, 
    cu.customerAddress
FROM 
    categories c
INNER JOIN 
    bills b ON c.CategoryID = b.CategoryID
LEFT JOIN 
    customer cu ON b.CustomerID = cu.CustomerID;
