## 1. Define Software Testing and Explain Its Importance in Software Development  

**Software Testing** is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure it meets specified requirements and is free of defects. It involves executing software components with manual or automated tools to identify errors, defects, or missing requirements.  

### **Importance of Software Testing:**  
- **Ensures Quality**: Helps deliver high-quality software that meets user expectations.  
- **Detects Bugs Early**: Identifies defects in the development phase, reducing costs and effort.  
- **Enhances Security**: Prevents vulnerabilities and ensures the software is safe from potential threats.  
- **Improves Performance**: Optimizes system performance and user experience.  
- **Ensures Compliance**: Confirms adherence to industry standards and regulations.  

**Example:**  
A banking app undergoes security testing to ensure users' financial data is protected from cyber threats.

## 2. Differentiate Between Error, Defect, and Failure  

| Term     | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Error** | A mistake made by a developer during coding. | A developer writes `x = x + y` instead of `x = x - y`, causing incorrect calculations. |
| **Defect (Bug)** | A flaw in the software that causes incorrect behavior. | A login button does not work due to incorrect event handling. |
| **Failure** | When the system does not perform as expected in a real-world scenario. | A website crashes when 10,000 users try to log in at the same time. |

## 3. Explain the "Pesticide Paradox" Principle in Software Testing and Its Importance  

### **Pesticide Paradox Principle:**  
The **Pesticide Paradox**, introduced by Boris Beizer, states that if the same set of test cases is executed repeatedly, they become ineffective in detecting new defects. Just like pests develop resistance to pesticides, software defects may remain undetected if testing is not updated regularly.  

### **Importance of Updating Test Cases:**  
- Helps uncover new defects missed by previous test cases.  
- Adapts to changes in software functionality.  
- Ensures continuous improvement in software quality.  

**Example:**  
A company updates its mobile app, adding a new payment method. If testers only run old test cases, they might miss bugs related to the new payment feature.

## 4. Difference Between Static and Dynamic Testing  

| Aspect  | Static Testing | Dynamic Testing |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Definition** | Examines code, design, and documents without executing the program. | Involves executing the software to find defects. |
| **When Done** | Early in the SDLC (before coding). | After coding is completed. |
| **Purpose** | Prevents defects before implementation. | Detects defects during execution. |
| **Examples** | Code reviews, walkthroughs, inspections. | Unit testing, integration testing, system testing. |

**Example:**  
- **Static Testing**: A developer reviews code for syntax errors before compilation.  
- **Dynamic Testing**: A tester runs the application and finds that the "Submit" button does not work.

## 5. How Early Testing in SDLC Helps Reduce Costs and Improve Software Quality  

### **Why Early Testing is Beneficial:**  
1. **Reduces Cost**: Fixing defects early in development is cheaper than fixing them after deployment.  
2. **Improves Quality**: Identifies issues early, preventing major failures.  
3. **Enhances Development Speed**: Prevents the accumulation of defects, reducing rework.  
4. **Minimizes Risks**: Lowers the chances of critical failures in production.  

### **Example:**  
A company follows **Shift Left Testing**, where testers review requirements and designs before development starts. This helps identify incorrect specifications early, avoiding costly rework later.
