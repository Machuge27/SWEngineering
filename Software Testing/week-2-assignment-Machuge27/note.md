![alt text](images/image.png)

Welcome to Week 2! In this lesson, we will explore the various types of software testing and their specific use cases. Understanding these types will help you choose the right testing approach for different scenarios in software development.

## Objectives üéØ

- Explore different types of software testing and their use cases.
- Understand the differences between functional and non-functional testing.

## Types of Testing Overview üß™

Software testing can be broadly categorized into two main types: Functional Testing and Non-Functional Testing. Each category serves different purposes and is essential for ensuring software quality.

### Functional Testing üîç

Functional testing focuses on verifying that the software functions according to specified requirements. It checks whether the application behaves as expected under various conditions. Here are the key types of functional testing:

| Type of Functional Testing | Description | Example |
|----------------------------|-------------|---------|
| Unit Testing               | Tests individual components or functions for correct behavior. | Checking if a function that calculates discounts works accurately. |
| Integration Testing        | Ensures that combined components work together correctly. | Verifying that different parts of an online shopping site communicate effectively during checkout. |
| System Testing             | Validates the complete system against specified requirements. | Testing an entire e-commerce platform to ensure all features work seamlessly together. |
| Acceptance Testing         | Conducted to determine if the software meets user needs and is ready for deployment. | End-users test an application to confirm it meets their requirements before launch. |

### Non-Functional Testing üöÄ

Non-functional testing evaluates aspects of the software that do not relate directly to specific behaviors or functions. It focuses on performance, usability, security, and other quality attributes. Here are the key types of non-functional testing:

| Type of Non-Functional Testing | Description | Example |
|--------------------------------|-------------|---------|
| Performance Testing            | Assesses how the application performs under various conditions. | Load testing a website to see how it handles multiple users simultaneously. |
| Security Testing               | Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection. | Conducting penetration tests to find security weaknesses in an application. |
| Usability Testing              | Evaluates how user-friendly and intuitive the application is. | Observing users as they navigate an app to identify areas for improvement. |
| Compatibility Testing          | Ensures that the software works across different devices, browsers, and operating systems. | Testing a web application on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure consistent performance. |

## Manual vs. Automated Testing ü§ñ

Testing can also be categorized based on how it is executed: manually or automatically.

- **Manual Testing**: Testers execute test cases manually without using automation tools. This approach is often used for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing.
- **Automated Testing**: Test scripts are written and executed using automation tools, allowing for faster execution of repetitive tests and greater coverage.

# Key Differences Between Manual and Automated Testing  

| **Aspect**         | **Manual Testing**                              | **Automated Testing**                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**      | Performed by human testers                    | Executed by automation tools                  |
| **Speed**         | Slower due to manual execution                 | Faster execution of repetitive tests         |
| **Cost-effectiveness** | More cost-effective for smaller projects or exploratory testing | More cost-effective for large projects with repetitive tests |
| **Flexibility**    | More adaptable to changes in requirements during testing phases | Requires maintenance of automation scripts when changes occur |

## Regression vs. Retesting üîÑ  

Understanding **regression** and **retesting** is crucial in maintaining software quality:  

- **Regression Testing**: Conducted after changes (like bug fixes or new features) to ensure that existing functionality remains unaffected.  
- **Retesting**: Involves executing specific test cases that failed in previous tests after defects have been fixed, ensuring those specific issues are resolved.

## Objectives üéØ
- Understand the concepts of regression testing and retesting.
- Recognize the importance of each in ensuring software reliability.

## What is Regression Testing? üîÑ

Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures that recent changes or enhancements to the code do not adversely affect existing functionality. It involves re-running previously completed tests to confirm that the application still performs as expected after modifications.

### Key Characteristics of Regression Testing:
- **Broad Coverage**: Tests a wide range of functionalities to ensure that no existing features are broken.
- **Automation Friendly**: Often automated due to the repetitive nature of the tests, making it efficient for large applications.
- **Performed After Changes**: Conducted after any code changes, such as bug fixes, enhancements, or new feature additions.

### Importance of Regression Testing:
- **Ensures Stability**: Confirms that existing functionality remains intact after changes.
- **Identifies Side Effects**: Detects any unintended consequences of code modifications.
- **Build Confidence**: Provides assurance to stakeholders that the software continues to meet quality standards.

## What is Retesting? ‚úîÔ∏è

Retesting is the process of executing specific test cases that previously failed after defects have been fixed. The goal is to verify that the identified issues have been resolved and that the application now behaves as expected.

### Key Characteristics of Retesting:
- **Focused Approach**: Targets specific defects rather than broad functionality.
- **Same Test Cases**: The same test cases are executed again to confirm defect resolution.
- **Performed After Fixes**: Conducted immediately after developers address reported issues.

### Importance of Retesting:
- **Validates Fixes**: Ensures that reported defects have been successfully resolved.
- **Prevents Recurrence**: Helps confirm that fixes do not introduce new issues.
- **Enhances Quality Assurance**: Contributes to overall software quality by ensuring defect resolution.

## Key Differences Between Regression Testing and Retesting üîç

#### Early Testing
Start testing activities as early as possible in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Early testing helps identify defects before they propagate further into the development process, reducing costs and effort associated with fixing them later.

#### Test Planning
Develop a comprehensive test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and approach for testing. A well-defined test plan serves as a roadmap for the testing process and ensures all team members are aligned.

#### Prioritize Testing Based on Risk
Focus on high-risk areas of the application where defects are more likely to occur or where failures could have significant consequences. Prioritizing testing efforts helps allocate resources effectively and improves overall quality.

#### Use of Automation
Leverage automated testing tools for repetitive and time-consuming tasks. Automation can significantly speed up the testing process, especially for regression and performance testing, while also increasing test coverage.

#### Maintain Test Cases
Regularly review and update test cases to ensure they remain relevant and effective. This practice helps address changes in requirements or application features and ensures that tests continue to provide value.

#### Incorporate Continuous Testing
Integrate testing into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Continuous testing allows for immediate feedback on code changes, enabling teams to identify issues early and maintain high-quality standards throughout development.

#### Encourage Collaboration
Foster collaboration between testers, developers, and stakeholders throughout the development process. Open communication helps ensure that everyone is aligned on requirements, expectations, and potential risks.

#### Conduct Regular Reviews
Implement regular reviews of test plans, test cases, and results to identify areas for improvement. Learning from past experiences can help refine testing strategies and enhance overall quality assurance practices.

#### Focus on User Experience
![alt text](images/image-2.png)
