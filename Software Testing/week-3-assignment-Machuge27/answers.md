## ðŸ“š Assignment Questions  

### 1. What is static testing, and why is it important in software development?  
Static testing is a type of software testing where the code is examined without executing the program. It is important because it helps identify defects early in the development process, reduces development costs, and improves software quality by ensuring code standards and guidelines are followed.

### 2. Differentiate between walkthroughs, technical reviews, and inspections. How do they help in static testing?  
- **Walkthroughs**: Informal meetings where the author of the document or code explains it to the team to gather feedback.
- **Technical Reviews**: Formal meetings where a team of experts examines the code or document to identify defects and suggest improvements.
- **Inspections**: Highly formal and structured meetings where the code or document is thoroughly reviewed against predefined criteria to detect defects.

These methods help in static testing by identifying defects early, ensuring adherence to standards, and improving the overall quality of the software.

### 3. What are static analysis tools, and how do they improve software quality?  
Static analysis tools are software applications that analyze code without executing it to detect potential errors, code smells, and adherence to coding standards. They improve software quality by providing early feedback on code issues, ensuring consistency, and reducing the likelihood of defects in the final product.

### 4. Mention two benefits of using static analysis tools in software development.  
1. **Early Detection of Defects**: Static analysis tools help identify issues early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later.
2. **Improved Code Quality**: By enforcing coding standards and best practices, static analysis tools help maintain high code quality and reduce the risk of defects.

### 5. List two popular static analysis tools and briefly describe their key features.  
1. **SonarQube**: Provides continuous inspection of code quality, supports multiple programming languages, and integrates with various CI/CD pipelines.
2. **ESLint**: A static analysis tool for JavaScript that identifies and fixes problems in code, enforces coding standards, and supports custom rule creation.
