To merge changes from your new branch into the main branch (or any other branch) in Git, follow these steps:

1. **Commit Your Changes**: Make sure your changes on the new branch are committed. If they’re not, Git won’t merge them.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

2. **Switch to the Target Branch**: Switch to the branch you want to merge into, typically `main` or `master`.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

3. **Pull the Latest Changes** (Optional): It’s a good practice to pull the latest changes to ensure your main branch is up-to-date with the remote repository before merging.

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Merge the New Branch**: Now, merge your new branch (replace `new-branch-name` with the actual branch name).

   ```bash
   git merge new-branch-name
   ```

5. **Resolve Conflicts** (If Any): If there are conflicts, Git will alert you, and you’ll need to resolve them manually. Open the conflicted files, make the necessary adjustments, save the changes, and mark them as resolved.

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

6. **Commit the Merge**: If there were conflicts that you resolved, commit the merge.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
   ```

7. **Push the Changes**: Finally, push the merged changes to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Explanation of Each Step

- **Committing changes** ensures all your edits are saved in Git.
- **Switching branches** tells Git where to apply the merge.
- **Pulling latest changes** helps prevent conflicts by synchronizing with the latest remote changes.
- **Merging branches** combines the changes from your new branch into the main one.
- **Resolving conflicts** is required if the same files were changed in both branches.
- **Pushing changes** makes sure your changes are saved remotely.
