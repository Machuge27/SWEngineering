The issue is likely due to **submodules** in your repository. If a folder in your GitHub repository appears as a link but does not open when clicked, it is probably a **Git submodule**, which means it is a separate repository linked within your main repository.

## **How to Fix the Issue**
You have a few options depending on what you want to do with the submodule.

### **1. Clone the Repository with Submodules Properly**
If you (or others) are cloning the repository and not seeing the submodules correctly, make sure to use:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>
```

If you've already cloned the repository, you can initialize and update the submodules manually:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### **2. Remove the Submodule (If You Don't Need It)**
If you don't actually want a submodule and instead want a normal folder with files, you need to remove the submodule reference.

#### **Steps to Remove a Submodule**
1. **Deinitialize the submodule**  
   ```sh
   git submodule deinit -f -- <submodule-folder>
   ```
2. **Remove the submodule directory from Git**  
   ```sh
   git rm -rf <submodule-folder>
   ```
3. **Commit the changes**  
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Removed submodule <submodule-folder>"
   ```
4. **Delete the submodule entry from `.gitmodules`** (if it exists)  
   Open `.gitmodules` and remove the corresponding section.
5. **Push the changes to GitHub**  
   ```sh
   git push origin main  # Change 'main' to your branch name
   ```

### **3. Convert Submodule to a Normal Folder**
If you actually want to keep the files from the submodule but make them part of your main repository:

1. **Remove the submodule reference, but keep its files:**
   ```sh
   git rm --cached <submodule-folder>
   ```
2. **Commit the changes:**
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Converted submodule to normal folder"
   ```
3. **Push the changes to GitHub:**
   ```sh
   git push origin main  # Change 'main' to your branch name
   ```

### **4. Check GitHub Repository Settings**
If you're still facing issues, check if GitHub correctly detects your submodules. Sometimes, it might display the folder as a submodule link without loading the content. You can verify this in:

1. **GitHub Repository → Settings → Submodules**
2. If it's listed incorrectly, remove or update it using the steps above.
